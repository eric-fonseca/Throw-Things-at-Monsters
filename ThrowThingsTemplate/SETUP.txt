SETUP FOR VISUAL STUDIO PROJECT:

COPY THE TEMPLATE TO YOUR DESKTOP. DO NOT MODIFY THE VERSION ON GITHUB!!!!!!!!!

BASIC SETUP:

You are most likely currently missing the BIN directory which is where our output of ThrowThings will be place.

I gave you all a folder called dependencies. Copy that to the SAME DIRECTORY as this file.

You need to create the (bin) folder in the SAME DIRECTORY as this file.

Now copy the .DLL files from the DEPENDENCIES/COPY directory I gave you guys to this bin folder.


SETUP IF VIXEN LIBRARIES CHANGE:

You will need to copy the files from the BIN folder in the Git repo. Into the BIN folder of your ThrowThingsTemplate. (*same bin folder you created above)
